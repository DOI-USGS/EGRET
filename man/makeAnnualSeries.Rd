\title{Produces annual series of 8 streamflow statistics (and a lowess smooth of them) from daily streamflow data}
\usage{
makeAnnualSeries(eList, edgeAdjust = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least Daily and INFO dataframes}

\item{edgeAdjust}{logical specifying whether to use the modified method for 
calculating the windows at the edge of the record.  The modified method tends to 
reduce curvature near the start and end of record.  
Default is TRUE, but a logical in INFO$edgeAdjust will override the default.}
}
\value{
annualSeries data frame that contains the annual series of streamflow statistics
}
\description{
Part of the flowHistory system.  The data come from Daily and INFO data frames. 
Note that the function setPA must be run before this to establish the period of analysis (e.g. water year).
