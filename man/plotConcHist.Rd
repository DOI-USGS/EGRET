\usage{
plotConcHist(
  eList,
  yearStart = NA,
  yearEnd = NA,
  DailyK = NA,
  concMax = NA,
  printTitle = TRUE,
  tinyPlot = FALSE,
  usgsStyle = FALSE,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least the Daily and INFO dataframes}

\item{yearStart}{numeric is the calendar year containing the first estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{yearEnd}{numeric is the calendar year just after the last estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{DailyK}{data frame returned from \code{makeDailyK}}

\item{concMax}{numeric. Maximum value of concentration to be plotted.}

\item{printTitle}{logical variable if TRUE title is printed, if FALSE title is not printed (this is best for a multi-plot figure)}

\item{tinyPlot}{logical variable, if TRUE plot is designed to be plotted small, as a part of a multipart figure, default is FALSE}

\item{usgsStyle}{logical option to use USGS style guidelines. Setting this option
to TRUE does NOT guarantee USGS complience. It will only change automatically
generated labels}

\item{plotFlowNorm}{logical variable if TRUE flow normalized line is plotted, if FALSE not plotted}

\item{plotAnnual}{logical variable if TRUE annual concentration points are plotted, if FALSE not plotted}

\item{cex}{numerical value giving the amount by which plotting symbols should be magnified}

\item{cex.axis}{magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{cex.main}{magnification to be used for main titles relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{lwd}{number magnification of line width.}

\item{col}{color of points on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{col.pred}{color of flow normalized line on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{customPar}{logical defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, par() should be set by user before calling this function 
(for example, adjusting margins with par(mar=c(5,5,5,5))). If customPar FALSE, EGRET chooses the best margins depending on tinyPlot.}

\item{\dots}{arbitrary graphical parameters that will be passed to genericEGRETDotPlot function (see ?par for options)}
}
\description{
Data come from named list, which contains a Daily dataframe with the daily flow data,
and an INFO dataframe with metadata. 

The annual concentrations are "time-weighted" mean concentrations (as opposed to "flow-weighted"). 
The annual results reported are for a specified "period of analysis" which can be 
an entire water year, a calendar, a season or even an individual month.  
User specifies this period of analysis in the call to \code{setupYears}.

Although there are a lot of optional arguments to this function, most are set to a logical default.
