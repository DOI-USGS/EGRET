\arguments{
\item{q1}{numeric This is the discharge value for the first curve to be shown on the plot. It is expressed in units specified by qUnit.}

\item{q2}{numeric This is the discharge value for the second curve to be shown on the plot. It is expressed in units specified by qUnit. If you don't want a second curve then the argument must be q2=NA}

\item{q3}{numeric This is the discharge value for the third curve to be shown on the plot. It is expressed in units specified by qUnit. If you don't want a third curve then the argument must be q3=NA}

\item{centerDate}{string This is the time of year to be used as the center date for the smoothing. It is expressed as a month and day and must be in the form "mm-dd"}

\item{yearStart}{numeric This is the starting year for the graph. The first value plotted for each curve will be at the first instance of centerDate in the year designated by yearStart.}

\item{yearEnd}{numeric This is the end of the sequence of values plotted on the graph.The last value will be the last instance of centerDate prior to the start of yearEnd. (Note, the number of values plotted on each curve will be yearEnd-yearStart.)}

\item{qUnit}{object of qUnit class. \code{\link{qConst}}, or numeric represented the short code, or character representing the descriptive name.}

\item{legendLeft}{numeric which represents the left edge of the legend in the units of the plot.}

\item{legendTop}{numeric which represents the top edge of the legend in the units of the plot.}

\item{concMax}{numeric value for upper limit on concentration shown on the graph, default = NA (which causes the upper limit to be set automatically, based on the data)}

\item{concMin}{numeric value for lower limit on concentration shown on the graph, default = NA (which causes the lower limit to be set automatically, based on the data)}

\item{bw}{logical if TRUE graph is produced in black and white, default is FALSE (which means it will use color)}

\item{printTitle}{logical variable if TRUE title is printed, if FALSE not printed}

\item{colors}{color vector of lines on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'. Defaults to c("black","red","green")}

\item{printValues}{logical variable if TRUE the results shown on the graph are printed to the console and returned in a dataframe (this can be useful for quantifying the changes seen visually in the graph), default is FALSE (not printed)}

\item{localSample}{data frame that contains the Sample data, default name is Sample}

\item{localINFO}{data frame that contains the metadata, default name is INFO}

\item{tinyPlot}{logical variable, if TRUE plot is designed to be plotted small, as a part of a multipart figure, default is FALSE}

\item{minNumObs}{numeric specifying the miniumum number of observations required to run the weighted regression, default is 100}

\item{minNumUncen}{numeric specifying the minimum number of uncensored observations to run the weighted regression, default is 50}

\item{windowY}{numeric specifying the half-window width in the time dimension, in units of years, default is 10}

\item{windowQ}{numeric specifying the half-window width in the discharge dimension, units are natural log units, default is 2}

\item{windowS}{numeric specifying the half-window with in the seasonal dimension, in units of years, default is 0.5}

\item{cex.main}{magnification to be used for main titles relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{lwd}{line width, a positive number, defaulting to 1}

\item{printLegend}{logicalif TRUE, legend is included}

\item{cex.legend}{number magnification  of legend}

\item{cex}{numerical value giving the amount by which plotting symbols should be magnified}

\item{cex.axis}{magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{customPar}{logical defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, par() should be set by user before calling this function
(for example, adjusting margins with par(mar=c(5,5,5,5))). If customPar FALSE, EGRET chooses the best margins depending on tinyPlot.}

\item{lineVal}{vector of line types. Defaults to c(1,1,1) which is a solid line for each line. Options: 0=blank, 1=solid (default), 2=dashed, 3=dotted, 4=dotdash, 5=longdash, 6=twodash}

\item{logScale}{logical whether or not to use a log scale in the y axis.}

\item{edgeAdjust}{logical specifying whether to use the modified method for calculating the windows at the edge of the record.  The modified method tends to reduce curvature near the start and end of record.  Default is TRUE.}

\item{\dots}{arbitrary functions sent to the generic plotting function.  See ?par for details on possible parameters}
}
\description{
These plots show how the concentration-time relationship is changing over flow.

Although there are a lot of optional arguments to this function, most are set to a logical default. If your workspace
contains an INFO, and Sample dataframes, 3 discharge values, a center date, and start and end years, then the following R code will produce a plot:
\code{plotConcTimeSmooth(q1, q2, q3, centerDate, yearStart, yearEnd)}
}
\examples{
q1 <- 10
q2 <- 25
q3 <- 75
centerDate <- "07-01"
yearStart <- 2000
yearEnd <- 2010
Sample <- ChopSample
INFO <- ChopINFO
plotConcTimeSmooth(q1, q2, q3, centerDate, yearStart, yearEnd)
plotConcTimeSmooth(q1, q2, q3, centerDate, yearStart, yearEnd,logScale=TRUE)
