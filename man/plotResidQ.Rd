\usage{
plotResidQ(eList, qUnit = 2, tinyPlot = FALSE, stdResid = FALSE,
  printTitle = TRUE, col = "black", lwd = 1, cex = 0.8,
  cex.axis = 1.1, cex.main = 1.1, rmSciX = FALSE, customPar = FALSE,

}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least the Sample and INFO dataframes}

\item{qUnit}{object of qUnit class \code{\link{printqUnitCheatSheet}}, or numeric represented the short code, or character representing the descriptive name.}

\item{tinyPlot}{logical variable, if TRUE plot is designed to be plotted small as part of a multipart figure, default is FALSE.}

\item{stdResid}{logical variable, if TRUE it uses the standardized residual, if FALSE it uses the actual, default is FALSE}

\item{printTitle}{logical variable if TRUE title is printed, if FALSE not printed (this is best for a multi-plot figure)}

\item{col}{color of points on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{lwd}{number line width}

\item{cex}{numerical value giving the amount by which plotting symbols should be magnified}

\item{cex.axis}{magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{cex.main}{magnification to be used for main titles relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{rmSciX}{logical defaults to FALSE, changes x label from scientific to fixed}

\item{customPar}{logical defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, par() should be set by user before calling this function 
(for example, adjusting margins with par(mar=c(5,5,5,5))). If customPar FALSE, EGRET chooses the best margins depending on tinyPlot.}

\item{randomCensored}{logical. Show censored residuals as randomized.}

\item{\dots}{arbitrary graphical parameters that will be passed to genericEGRETDotPlot function (see ?par for options)}
}
\description{
This function produces a plot of the residuals from WRTDS, expressed in natural log concentration units
versus the discharge shown on a log scale. 
The function also provides an alternative for viewing the standardized residuals, where the each residual is divided by its estimated standard error

 Although there are a lot of optional arguments to this function, most are set to a logical default.
 
Data come from named list, which contains a Sample dataframe with the sample data, 
and an INFO dataframe with metadata.
