\title{Graph of annual flux and flow normalized flux versus year}
\usage{
plotFluxHist(yearStart = NA, yearEnd = NA, fluxUnit = 9,
  localDaily = Daily, localINFO = INFO, fluxMax = NA, printTitle = TRUE,
  plotFlowNorm = TRUE, tinyPlot = FALSE, col = "black",
  col.pred = "green", cex = 0.8, cex.axis = 1.1, cex.main = 1.1,
  lwd = 2, customPar = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{yearStart}{numeric is the calendar year containing the first estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{yearEnd}{numeric is the calendar year just after the last estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{fluxUnit}{number representing entry in pre-defined fluxUnit class array. \code{\link{fluxConst}}}

\item{localDaily}{data frame that contains the flow data, default name is Daily}

\item{localINFO}{data frame that contains the metadata, default name is INFO}

\item{fluxMax}{number specifying the maximum value to be used on the vertical axis, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{printTitle}{logical variable if TRUE title is printed, if FALSE title is not printed (this is best for a multi-plot figure)}

\item{plotFlowNorm}{logical variable if TRUE the flow normalized line is plotted, if FALSE not plotted}

\item{tinyPlot}{logical variable, if TRUE plot is designed to be plotted small, as a part of a multipart figure, default is FALSE}

\item{col}{color of points on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{col.pred}{color of flow normalized line on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{cex}{numerical value giving the amount by which plotting symbols should be magnified}

\item{cex.axis}{magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{cex.main}{magnification to be used for main titles relative to the current setting of cex}

\item{lwd}{number line width}

\item{customPar}{logical defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, par() should be set by user before calling this function
(for example, adjusting margins with par(mar=c(5,5,5,5))). If customPar FALSE, EGRET chooses the best margins depending on tinyPlot.}

\item{\dots}{arbitrary graphical parameters that will be passed to genericEGRETDotPlot function (see ?par for options)}
}
\description{
Data come from a data frame named AnnualResults.
The metadata come from a data frame named INFO.
The annual results reported are for a specified "period of analysis" which can be
an entire water year, a calendar, a season or even an individual month.
The user specifies this period of analysis in the call to setupYears.

Although there are a lot of optional arguments to this function, most are set to a logical default. If your workspace
contains an INFO and AnnualResults (from either modelEstimation or setupYears) dataframes, an annualSeries array, and the istat number (1-8), then the following R code will produce a plot:
\code{plotFluxHist()}
}
\examples{
yearStart <- 2001
yearEnd <- 2010
Daily <- ChopDaily
INFO <- ChopINFO
# Water year:
INFO <- setPA()
plotFluxHist()
plotFluxHist(yearStart, yearEnd, fluxUnit = 1)
plotFluxHist(yearStart, yearEnd, fluxUnit = 'kgDay')
# Graphs consisting of Jun-Aug
INFO <- setPA(paStart=6,paLong=3)
plotFluxHist()
