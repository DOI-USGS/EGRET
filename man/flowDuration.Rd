\title{Computes several values of the flow duration curve for streamflow centered on a specific date of the year}
\usage{
flowDuration(eList, centerDate = "09-30", qUnit = 2, span = 365)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least Daily and INFO dataframes}

\item{centerDate}{character specifying the center date of the part of the year for which the flow
duration is to be calculated, it is in the form "mm-dd" (it must be in quotes), default is 
"09-30"}

\item{qUnit}{object of qUnit class \code{\link{printqUnitCheatSheet}}, or numeric represented the short code,
or character representing the descriptive name.}

\item{span}{number this is the half-width of the window over which the discharge values are to 
be used in constructing the flow-duration curve. If the full year is desired any value greater 
than 182 will provide serve. Note that for a window of about 2-months width, a span value shoud 
be about 30.}
}
\value{
qDuration A named vector with flow duration information.
}
\description{
This function is useful for helping the analyst determine the empirical probability distribution of 
streamflow for a particular part of the year or for the whole year. 
This is particularly useful in setting up discharge scales for various other plots in this package.
}
\examples{
eList <- Choptank_eList
# for a window of 30 days either side of June 25 expressed in units of cfs:
flowDuration(eList,"06-25", qUnit=1,span=30) 
# for a flow-duration curve covering the whole year, expressed in units of csf: 
flowDuration(eList, "01-01", qUnit=2)
