\usage{
plotConcTime(eList, qUnit = 2, yearStart = NA, yearEnd = NA,
  qLower = NA, qUpper = NA, randomCensored = FALSE, tinyPlot = FALSE,
  concMax = NA, concMin = NA, printTitle = TRUE, logScale = FALSE,
  cex = 0.8, cex.axis = 1.1, cex.main = 1.1, customPar = FALSE,
  col = "black", lwd = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least the Sample and INFO dataframes}

\item{qUnit}{object of qUnit class \code{\link{printqUnitCheatSheet}}, or numeric represented the short code, or character representing the descriptive name.}

\item{yearStart}{numeric is the calendar year containing the first estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{yearEnd}{numeric is the calendar year just after the last estimated annual value to be plotted, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{qLower}{numeric the lower bound on values of discharge used to select the data points to be plotted, units are those specified by qUnit, default = NA which is equivalent to a lower bound of zero but if the desired lower bound is zero use qLower = NA}

\item{qUpper}{numeric the upper bound on values of discharge for selection of data points to be plotted, units are those specified by qUnit, default = NA which is equivalent to an upper bound of infinity}

\item{randomCensored}{logical. Show censored values as randomized.}

\item{tinyPlot}{logical variable, if TRUE plot is designed to be plotted small as part of a multipart figure, default is FALSE.}

\item{concMax}{numeric value for the maximum value to be used on the vertical axis, default is NA (which allows it to be set automatically by the data)}

\item{concMin}{numeric value for lower limit on concentration shown on the vertical log graph, default is NA 
(which causes the lower limit to be set automatically, based on the data). This value is ignored for linear scales, using 0 as the minimum value for the concentration axis.}

\item{printTitle}{logical variable if TRUE title is printed, if FALSE title is not printed (this is best for a multi-plot figure).}

\item{logScale}{logical, default FALSE, FALSE creates a linear scale y-axis, TRUE creates a y-axis is in log scale.}

\item{cex}{numerical value giving the amount by which plotting symbols should be magnified.}

\item{cex.axis}{magnification to be used for axis annotation relative to the current setting of cex.}

\item{cex.main}{magnification to be used for main titles relative to the current setting of cex.}

\item{customPar}{logical defaults to FALSE. If TRUE, par() should be set by user before calling this function.
(for example, adjusting margins with par(mar=c(5,5,5,5))). If customPar FALSE, EGRET chooses the best margins depending on tinyPlot.}

\item{col}{color of points on plot, see ?par 'Color Specification'}

\item{lwd}{number line width.}

\item{\dots}{arbitrary functions sent to the generic plotting function.  See ?par for details on possible parameters.}
}
\description{
This function allows the user to plot all of the data, but also to limit it in two ways. 
  The data can be limited to only those observed concentrations collected in a specified discharge range. 
  The data can also be limited to only those observed in certain months of the year. 
    These two selection criteria can be combined. For example, 
    we may only want to plot data for discharges between 100 and 500 cubic feet per second in the months of March, April and May.
    
Although there are a lot of optional arguments to this function, most are set to a logical default.

Data come from named list, which contains a Sample dataframe with the sample data, 
and an INFO dataframe with metadata.
