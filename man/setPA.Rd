\title{Sets up the period of analysis (the portion of the year being evaluated).}
\usage{
setPA(eList, paStart = 10, paLong = 12, window = 20)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least the INFO dataframe}

\item{paStart}{A numeric value for the starting month of the Period of Analysis, default is 10}

\item{paLong}{A numeric value for the length of the Period of Analysis in months, default is 12}

\item{window}{A numeric value for the half-width of a smoothing window for annual streamflow values, default is 20}
}
\value{
eList named list with at least the INFO dataframe, along any other part of the list that was input. 
Any of these values can be NA, not all EGRET functions will work with missing parts of the named list eList.
}
\description{
Period of analysis is defined by the starting month (paStart) and length in months (paLong). 
paStart and paLong are constrained to be integers from 1 to 12. 
for example, a water year would be paStart = 10 and paLong = 12. 
for example, the winter season, defined by Dec,Jan,Feb would be paStart = 12 and paLong =3.
