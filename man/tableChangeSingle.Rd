\title{Create a table of the changes in flow-normalized concentration or flux values between various points in time in the record}
\usage{
tableChangeSingle(eList, fluxUnit = 9, yearPoints = NA, flux = FALSE,
  flowNormYears = "all", waterYear = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{eList}{named list with at least Daily and INFO dataframes}

\item{fluxUnit}{object of fluxUnit class. \code{\link{printFluxUnitCheatSheet}}, or numeric represented the short code, or character representing the descriptive name.}

\item{yearPoints}{numeric vector listing the years for which the change or slope computations are made, they need to be in chronological order.  For example yearPoints=c(1975,1985,1995,2005), default is NA (which allows the program to set yearPoints automatically)}

\item{flux}{logical if TRUE results are returned in flux, if FALSE concentration. Default is set to FALSE.}

\item{flowNormYears}{vector of flow years}

\item{waterYear}{logical. Should years be water years (\code{TRUE}) or calendar years (\code{FALSE})}
}
\value{
resultsDF dataframe describing trends in flow-normalized concentration or flux if returnDataFrame is TRUE

dataframe with Year1, Year2, change[mg/L], slope[mg/L], change[percent], slope[percent] columns. The data in each row is the change or slope calculated from Year1 to Year2
}
\description{
This table describe trends in flow-normalized concentration or flux depending on if flux is defined as TRUE or FALSE. 
The results are described as changes in real units or in percent and als as slopes in real units per year or in percent per year.
They are computed over pairs of time points (Year1 to Year2).  These time points can be user-defined or
they can be set by the program to be the final year of the record and a set of years that are multiple of 5 years prior to that.

eList <- Choptank_eList
# Water Year:
#This returns concentration ASCII table in the console:
tableChangeSingle(eList, fluxUnit=6,yearPoints=c(2001,2005,2008,2009), flux=FALSE)
#This returns flux values ASCII table in the console
tableChangeSingle(eList, fluxUnit=6,yearPoints=c(2001,2005,2008,2009), flux=TRUE)  
# Winter:
