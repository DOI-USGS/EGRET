# WRTDS References

This is a bibliography of published works that develop or use Weighted Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS).  It is current as of April 1, 2020.  It includes papers in scientific journals and government agency reports but not theses or dissertations or published drafts of government reports.  The publications included here are those that develop or use WRTDS.  Publications that reference WRTDS-related papers, but don’t use the method are not included. 

This bibliography is organized in three sections:

[The WRTDS Method](#the-wrtds-method): These are papers that define and explain aspects of the WRTDS methods written by members of the team that has developed the method and the related EGRET R-package (Exploration and Graphics for RivEr Trends).  They cover a 10-year period (2010-2019) of development and enhancements of the method.  The methods described are all included either in the EGRET or EGRETci packages or in additional R scripts that can be found under the "Articles" menu of the EGRET home page (https://usgs-r.github.io/EGRET/).

[Extending and Evaluating WRTDS](#extending-and-evaluating-wrtds):  These are papers in which extensions have been made of the basic WRTDS methods to bring in other types of information or to provide other types of outputs.  The list also includes papers that make comparisons between WRTDS and other statistical methods commonly used with river water quality data.

[Regional Studies Using WRTDS](#regional-studies-using-wrtds): These are all papers that apply the WRTDS to the evaluation of conditions over a collection of monitoring sites.  In a few cases these are just single sites but in most are based on a group of sites covering a region or even the entire United States.
