EGRET 1.2.4
===========
* Plotting functions updated to allow users better control.


EGRET 1.2.3
===========

* New estDailyFromSurfaces function utilizing "fields" package, written by Jeffrey Chanat.
  Greatly increases the speed of computations of the daily results.  Two additional R packages are needed: fields and spam

* Improved documentation, especially example functions.

* runSurvReg modified to include the option of a very wide seasonal window (windowS), which has the effect of eliminating the influence of the seasonal weights.

* Progress indicators modified to be more informative.

* Fixed a calculation bug in function plotLogFluxPred.

EGRET 1.2.1
===========

* Adds four new functions to the flowHistory capability. The four new flow History functions are: plot15 (makes an array of 15 plots for a given site - a matrix of 3 flow statistics (7-day min, mean, and 1-day max) versus 5 periods of analysis (annual, fall, winter, spring, and summer), plotSDLogQ (makes a plot of the running standard deviation of the Log Discharge versus time), plotFour (makes a set of four graphs: 1-day max, mean, 7-day min, and running standard deviation of the logs), and plotQTimeDaily (a way to plot discharge versus time, setup particularly to show flows above some threshold discharge). 

* Bug fix in WRTDS made no changes to calculations, it just prevents a crash in a situation where the user has shortened the length of the daily record.

EGRET 1.1.3
===========

* A few small bug fixes and cosmetic changes in some graphics, improved saveResults function, and better formatting of help pages for the functions.

EGRET 1.0.0
===========

* Initial release.
