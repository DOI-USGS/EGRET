Description: Statistics and graphics for streamflow history,
    water quality trends, and the statistical modeling algorithm: Weighted
    Regressions on Time, Discharge, and Season (WRTDS). The modeling
    method is introduced and discussed in Hirsch et al. (2010) <doi:10.1111/j.1752-1688.2010.00482.x>,
    and expanded in Hirsch and De Cicco (2015) <doi:10.3133/tm4A10>.
